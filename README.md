# 🌐 Mardell.me Personal Site

This is my tiny digital outpost on the web, cobbled together with Next.js and curiosity. Check it out live at
[mardell.me](https://mardell.me)

## 🚀 Features

It's a simple site... there's not a lot to look at and certainly not a big undertaking. But I had fun building it - here
are some features:

- **Spotify Integration**: See what I'm currently jamming to or what's recently been playing 🎵.
- **Work Showcase**: A playground of my personal projects and experiments 🛠.
- **Contact Page**: Drop me a line through my site, directly hitting my inbox via Mailgun API 📬.

## 💻 Development

To get the local development server running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site in action. You'll probably need some
private `.env` variables to get it working.
